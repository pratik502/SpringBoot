In this Project group 1 has below projects:
If you want to test Hystrix then you need to run below 3 projects
1)EurekaServer
2)HystrixClient
3)HystrixService


Project 2
Run SpringCloudServer1 (8888) and SpringConfigClient1 (8081)
No need of Eureka Server

If we change any property in the Cloud server (e.g Item2) then it will be immediately reflected in cloud server (http://localhost:8888/Item/macd). No need to refresh actuator
But in the ConfigClient1, it will NOT reflect unless we refresh actuator endpoint 
For Client ,we need to call below service

C:\Users\pagadge.I-FLEX>curl localhost:8081/actuator/refresh -d {} -H "Content-Type: application/json"
["config.client.version","item2"]

It will return changed values
